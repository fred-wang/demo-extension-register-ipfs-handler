# Demo : Extension to register a local HTTP gateway for IPFS

This is a small extension allowing to register a
[local HTTP gateway](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#gateway-providers)
for IPFS using `registerProtocolHandler()`. This is just a proof of concept for
[bug 64100](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=64100),
the UI can be refined (see [bug 1079333](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1079333) for example)
and it's not necessarily working in the latest versions of Chromium or other
browsers. Please check the official [IPFS website](https://ipfs.io/#install)
for official solutions working with current browsers.
